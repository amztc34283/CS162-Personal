1.  subl    $1, %eax
    subl    $12, %es
    pushl   %eax
    call    recur

2. The .text section contains the assembly code for the instructions while the .data section contains the initialized variables. In the recurse.c file, there is only read-only data section while the map.c file has the initialized variable stuff declared in .data section.

3. objdump -t map.obj

4. *UND is referring to the section which is referenced in the ELF file but is not defined there. g is referring to a global symbol. O is referring to an object symbol (probably some variables which can be accessed by other files). F is referring to a function symbol.

5. I think we can find the symbol of malloc in stdlib.c. 

6. We can also find the symbol of recur in map.obj.
   00000000         *UND*  00000000 recur

7. There are many irrelevant lines added to the new symbol table, probably coming from the dynamically-linked library.
